            <p class="text">Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Our aim is  to create automated systems that can quickly and accurately identify patterns indicative of pneumonia, helping radiologists make faster and more informed diagnoses.  This not only improves the speed of diagnosis but also has the potential to increase diagnostic accuracy, particularly in areas with limited access to specialist radiologists.</p>
